![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ericpelland/Watch-Animal-Photos/master/imgs/Screen_20181028_103208.png)

A Samsung smartwatch app that will randomly display images of animals on your watch to the settings of your choice.

## Features
* Choose between different animals to display random photos pulled from an API request to a few different websites.
* The app auto resizes the display of photos so they dont get streched or warped, but still utilize as much free space on the watch as possible.
* The app checks that the images recieved from the api are not broken or missing before displaying on the watch.
* A spinner is utilized to let the operator know when the network call is taking a second or two.  Sometimes the images are high quality, or other times you get gifted with a GIF!
* Choose between different timing settings to set the auto switch to the next photo, or set it to change on a tap or bezel spin.

## Settings

1) Click/Tap/Bezel
2) 1 Second
3) 2 Seconds
4) 3 Seconds
5) 4 Seconds
6) 5 Seconds

## Info
This app was created so I could learn how to create web apps that can run similar to native apps on samsung smartwatches.  The project might not be large, but it might be useful to other new watch developers.
